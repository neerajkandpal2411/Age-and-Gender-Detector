## 📌 Project Overview
The **Age & Gender Detector** is an AI-powered application that utilizes deep learning to analyze human faces and determine their **age group** and **gender** with high accuracy. This project uses **OpenCV** for image processing and **Deep Learning models** for classification.

## ✨ Features
✅ Real-time age & gender detection via images
✅ Supports image input
✅ Uses pre-trained deep learning models for high accuracy
✅ Lightweight and easy to run
✅ Can be integrated into other applications

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** 📷
- **Deep Learning (CNNs, TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch)** 🔥
- **Pre-trained Models** 🎭

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Face Detection**: Detects faces in an image using OpenCV.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key features from the detected face.
3. **Age & Gender Prediction**: Uses a trained CNN model to classify age & gender.
4. **Output**: Displays predictions in real-time.
